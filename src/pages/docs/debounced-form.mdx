# Debounced forms

## Introduction

Debounce function forces a function to wait a certain amount of time before running again. The function is built to limit the number of times a function is called.

The debounce parameter delays the updating of the state until the user has stopped changing inputs for a predetermined amount of time.

The input value is set to state values and then updated via React events. Defining a formâ€™s input value via state is considered a controlled component. For controlled inputs, you will need a corresponding state and then a function to update that state with changes.

[React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

It means that whenever state is changed the component, it is rendered again.

If you want to use this kind of form, you need only pass property `mode:'debounced'`.

Also, it means that the validations are run in every state change, providing better user feedback.
See more in Controlled Inputs with validation.

## Usage

`useForm` provides a `register` function, this function returns all properties to manager a field.

```javascript
/*
 *  initial Values optional
 */
const initialValues = {
  data1: 'test',
  data2: 'test2',
  nested: [
    {
      first: 'testComplexData',
      score: 45,
    },
  ],
}

const { state, register } = useForm({ initialValues, mode: 'debounced' })
```

Use dot notation to create advanced objects or to map object values. Type an entry name and type or an entry property object.

> Dot notation is used to access nested objects. For example, if you have an object with a nested object, you can access the nested object using dot notation; `info.name`.

<br />

> You can also use dot notation to access nested arrays. For example, if you
> have an object with a nested array, you can access the nested array using dot notation;
> `info.array[2]`.

```jsx
<input {...register("data1")}/>
<input {...register("nested[0]first")}/>
```
