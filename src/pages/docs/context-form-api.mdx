# ContextForm

## Context
>Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

Working with React it is very common to pass the data top-down via props, but it's not the better way if you have many props, you can do it better with Context.

>Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

You can find more information about Context in the official documentation https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html

## Why you my need ContextForm?
ContextForm provides a way to share a form state to other components in the tree. ContextForm is used with `useForm`, the values returned by useForm should be passed in value property.

This resource is useful when you want o use the form state in many components, for instance, if you have a multi-step form it's probably that you have a component that returns this step system, and every step is a part of the same form, In this case, you can use `ContextForm` to share the form state with all steps.
## Usage

```jsx

const form = useForm(...)


<ContextForm.Provider value={form}>

 {/* ....another components */}

</ContextForm.Provider>

```
