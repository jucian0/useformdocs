# Debounced mode

## Introduction

Debounce function forces a function to wait a certain amount of time before running again. The function is built to limit the number of times a function is called.

The debounce parameter delays the updating of the state until the user has stopped changing inputs for a predetermined amount of time.

The input value is set to state values and then updated via React events. Defining a formâ€™s input value via state is considered a controlled component. For controlled inputs, you will need a corresponding state and then a function to update that state with changes.

[React Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html)

It means that whenever state is changed the component, it is rendered again.

If you want to use this kind of form, you need only pass property `mode:'debounced'`.

Also, it means that the validations are run in every state change, providing better user feedback.
See more in Controlled Inputs with validation.

## Usage

`useForm` provides a `register` function, this function returns all properties to manager a field.

<CodeBlock language="jsx">
  {`import { createForm } from '@use-form/use-form'

const useForm = createForm({
  initialValues: {
    name: 'Anna',
    address: [
      {
        street: '123 Main St',
        city: 'Anytown',
      },
    ]
  }
})
`}
</CodeBlock>

Use dot notation to create advanced objects or to map object values. Type an entry name and type or an entry property object.

> Dot notation is used to access nested objects. For example, if you have an object with a nested object, you can access the nested object using dot notation; `info.name`.
> Use dot notation to access nested arrays. For example, if you
> have an object with a nested array, you can access the nested array using dot notation;
> `info.array[2]`.

<CodeBlock language="jsx">
  {`
   function Form(){
    const { register } = useForm({ mode: 'debounced'})

    return (
      <form>
        <input ref={register('name')} />
        <input ref={register('address.street')} />
        <input ref={register('address.city')} />
      </form>
    )
   }
`}
</CodeBlock>
